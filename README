recognized:

/client/connect/{client-id}/
 - 'GET' registers an arduino board when it is OK to receive commands

/control/{ip}:{cliend-id}/water 
 - 'GET' displays a form for confirmation
 - 'POST' tells the arduino board with the given ID connected to IP to do the 'water' action

/status/ - Generic status page.
